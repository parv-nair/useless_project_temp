## Project Description
A satirical website that features an endless loading screen animation, simulating the frustration of waiting indefinitely for a page to load. It's the pinnacle of internet futility!

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt the sheer thrill of watching a loading screen spin indefinitely? Well, we’re tackling the “problem” of webpages that load too quickly! People are losing out on the suspense and excitement of wondering, “Will this ever finish?”

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our solution? A website that loads... forever! With spinning animations and “loading” text that never progresses, we aim to bring back the glory days of slow internet with a modern twist. The perfect tool for those who love waiting without reason.
